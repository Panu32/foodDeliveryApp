**üçΩÔ∏è Food Delivery App** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application where users can upload and browse food items with name, description, price, category, and image. It features image uploads using Multer, real-time feedback using React Toastify, and organized code with a client-server folder structure. The frontend (React) is in the `client/` folder, and the backend (Express + MongoDB) is in the `server/` folder. To run the app, install dependencies in both folders, configure your `.env` file with MongoDB credentials, and run the backend with `npm start` and frontend with `npm run dev`. This app is perfect for learning how to build real-world full-stack CRUD applications with file uploads and clean UI.
