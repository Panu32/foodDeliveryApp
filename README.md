**üçΩÔ∏è Food Delivery App** is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application where **users can browse and order food**, while only the **admin can upload, manage, and delete food items**. It features secure image uploads using Multer, real-time notifications with React Toastify, and a clean client-server architecture. The frontend (React) resides in the `client/` folder, and the backend (Express + MongoDB) is in the `server/` folder. To run the project, install dependencies in both folders, configure the `.env` file with your MongoDB credentials, and start the backend with `npm start` and the frontend with `npm run dev`. This app is ideal for understanding admin-user role separation, CRUD operations, file uploads, and building production-ready full-stack apps.
